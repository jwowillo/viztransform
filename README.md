# `viztransform`

viztransform contains library-packages for working with and vizualizing rigid
plane-transformations, or isometries, along with command-packages for easily
simplifying, applying, and vizualizing these transformations from a CLI.

## Installing

Run `make` to make docs and all commands. Run `make doc` to only make
documentation. Run `make viztransform_apply|simplify|viz` to only make the
corresponding command.

## Running

Instructions for running `viztransform_apply|simplify|viz` can be found after
installing the commands by running `viztransform_apply|simplify|viz --help`.

Examples to test commands are in directory 'example'.

## Documentation

Documentation is located in directory 'doc' in the form of Markdown-files
for the project-requirements and project-design and a latex-file for the
simplification-algorithm discussion. PDFs generated from all of these are also
included.
